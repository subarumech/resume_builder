## Job Experiences

### CURIS System - Project Manager (March 2025 – Present) | Orlando, FL
- Managed engineering team of 5 people, mentoring two early-career engineers on mechanical design and fail-fast methodologies
- Led efforts in scaling design and manufacturing operations with facility projects ranging from $200,000 to $20,000,000
- Implemented R&D design processes for corporate alignment and ERP system integration
- Interacted with external vendors and customers for project management and procurement
- Directed multi-million dollar facility bio-decontamination system integrations
- Directed in-house R&D for next-generation product development
- Designed a product line from scratch. A portable sensor array. Did all of the mechanical, electrical, and software for it. And failure testing.

### MTronPTI - Manufacturing Engineer (Feb 2025 – March 2025) | Orlando, FL
- Enhanced manufacturing processes for DoD suppliers
- Created detailed assembly work instructions
- Created technical drawings and mechanical drawings in SolidWorks with GD&T (Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing) standards
- Applied lean manufacturing principles
- Built a station from scratch for precisely heating and flowing solder and precisely tinning the leads on delicate oscillator assemblies.
- Voluntarily left to pursue a significantly improved offer from a previous interview that was done before taking a job here.

### Neuralink - Production Facility Coordinator (March 2023 – June 2024) | Austin, TX
- Directed the construction and facilitization of a new manufacturing facility and lab with budgets in the tens of millions
- Managed budgets, schedules, and lean initiatives to achieve a 10x increase in N1 brain implant production capacity
- Interacted with external vendors and contractors for construction and machine purchases
- Led the construction of three full-scale production lines, cleanroom HVAC and power installations, medical-grade water systems, and dozens of other major improvements to pass regulatory compliance audits from the FDA and USDA
- Ensured compliance with 21 CFR 820 (Design Controls) and 21 CFR 812 (Investigational Device Exemptions)
- Designed and implemented mechanical assemblies to handle delicate brain implants to build, transport, and mount them
- Wrote large amounts of lab documentation and instructions
- Used tools like SolidWorks, Revit, and Google Workspace

### Neuralink - Manufacturing Technician (March 2022 – March 2023) | Austin, TX
- Acted as a Manufacturing Engineer, optimizing processes with SolidWorks and RCCA (Root Cause and Corrective Action)
- Reduced deviations of some steps by up to 30% using formal RCCA processes with hardware I designed, built, tested, and rolled into the line.
- Personally designed, built, and programmed a custom, auto-failover, pressurized gas system for the clean room gas supplies.
- Built Neuralink's entire inventory system from the ground up, both physically and in software, until software team integrated it into ERP system
- Authored work instructions, validations, process maps, and maintenance protocols for N1 brain implant assembly.
- Built N1 devices, tooling, and the manufacturing line itself. Utilized every tool imaginable, from microfab and probe stations to forklifts and lathes.

### SpaceX - Starship Integration Technician (June 2020 – October 2020) | Boca Chica, TX
- Installed cryogenic fuel systems, avionics, and hydraulics for Starship second stage vehicles SN5–SN12.
- Utilized technical schematics and diagrams to build these ships.
- Used Siemens NX to help improve manufacturing step of installing the LOX downcomer installation by several hours

### Altavian - Mechanical Engineering Intern (Sep 2018 – July 2019) | Gainesville, FL
- Designed and validated a new thermal management system for military drone systems, reducing internal peak temperatures by 8%. It had to work in sandy environments and fit in a tight space.
- Created detailed technical documentation and work instructions
- Developed MIL-SPEC cable harness molds for the drone system's base station / controller assembly.
- Automated BOM documentation for the DoD using SolidWorks macros, reducing manual intervention from engineers on making the BOMs.

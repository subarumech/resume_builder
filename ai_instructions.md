# AI Resume Customization Instructions

## Your Task
Read `my_achievements.md` and `job_posting.md`, then create a customized resume that matches the job requirements.

## Instructions
1. **Read the job posting** in `job_posting.md` to understand what the employer is looking for
2. **Review my achievements** in `my_achievements.md` to see all my experience and skills
3. **Select the most relevant experiences** (3-4 jobs) that best match the job requirements
4. **Customize the achievement bullets** to emphasize skills and experience that align with the job posting
5. **Choose relevant skills** from my skills sections that match what the employer wants
6. **Make a LaTeX file based on the layout of base_resume.tex** with the customized content

## Guidelines
- Stay truthful to my actual experiences - don't make things up
- Use keywords from the job posting where they naturally fit
- Emphasize quantified results and specific achievements
- Keep the same professional LaTeX formatting as the original
- Focus on the most relevant and impressive accomplishments
- Make sure the resume tells a coherent story about why I'm a good fit for this role

## Output
Create a new LaTeX file called `customized_resume.tex` in the root directory that I can compile to PDF.
